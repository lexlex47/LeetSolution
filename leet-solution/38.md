# 38. Count and Say

The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:

```text
1.     1
2.     11
3.     21
4.     1211
5.     111221
```

`1` is read off as `"one 1"` or `11`.  
`11` is read off as `"two 1s"` or `21`.  
`21` is read off as `"one 2`, then `one 1"` or `1211`.

Given an integer n where 1 ≤ _n_ ≤ 30, generate the nth term of the count-and-say sequence. You can do so recursively, in other words from the previous member read off the digits, counting the number of digits in groups of the same digit.

Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: 1
Output: "1"
Explanation: This is the base case.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: 4
Output: "1211"
Explanation: For n = 3 the term was "21" in which we have two groups "2" and "1", "2" can be read as "12" which means frequency = 1 and value = 2, the same way "1" is read as "11", so the answer is the concatenation of "12" and "11" which is "1211".
```



```text
# @param {Integer} n
# @return {String}
def count_and_say(n)
  
  base = 1
  current_arry = [base]
  
  return base.to_s if n-1 == 0
  
  (n-1).times do
    current_arry = cauculation(current_arry)
  end
  
  current_arry.join("")
  
end

def cauculation(current_arry)
  count = 1
  new_arry = []
    current_arry.each_with_index do |v,index|
      if current_arry[index + 1] != nil && current_arry[index + 1] == v
        count += 1
      else
        new_arry << count
        new_arry << v
        count = 1
      end
   end
  return new_arry
end
```
