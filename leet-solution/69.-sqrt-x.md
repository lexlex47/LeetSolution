# 69. Sqrt\(x\)

Implement `int sqrt(int x)`.

Compute and return the square root of _x_, where _x_ is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: 4
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since 
             the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
```



```text
# @param {Integer} x
# @return {Integer}
require 'mathn'
def my_sqrt(x)
  Math.sqrt(x).truncate(0)
end
```
